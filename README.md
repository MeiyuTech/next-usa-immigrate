# TODO:

- [ ] Add i18n and localization, which could help with the SEO and ToC (Table of Contents) in posts.
- [x] IMPROVE the sitemap!!!!
- [ ] Do we need ‘src/utilities/serialize.ts’? Try to find the build in function in Payload.
- [x] Create 'projects' and 'cases' pages, like Posts Page (or just add metadata('Related PAges' and 'Categories') for Pages? )
- [x] Which logo should we use? One is darker (witth text "美域佳华"), one's color looks better yet the bg is not perfectly deleted. 暂定为天蓝色。
- [x] Create a form and show the email resender, submission record.
- [x] AnimatedTitle disappears in mobile mode!!!
- [x] Theme selector shows layout mess in mobile mode!!!
- [x] 提供的图片没有背景，在黑色主题下文字看不清！！！ 和王艳沟通，让 潘总 zhangfeng 帮忙改 (changed the ImageMedia ‘style’, )
- [ ] Form is tricky, let them contact ppl first
- [ ] make all the links work
- [ ] add cases page

# i18n and localization

1. Modify `payload.config.ts`

```typescript
i18n: {
    fallbackLanguage: 'en',
  },
  localization: {
    locales: [
      {
        label: {
          en: 'English',
          zh: '英文',
        },
        code: 'en',
      },
      {
        label: {
          en: 'Chinese',
          zh: '中文',
        },
        code: 'zh',
      },
    ],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    fallback: true,
  },
```

2. And after that, it goes:

```bash
+ snapshot column will be created

+ published_locale column will be created
--- all columns conflicts in _posts_v table resolved ---


+ snapshot column will be created

+ published_locale column will be created
--- all columns conflicts in _pages_v table resolved ---

# Next.js Immigration Website

A modern immigration consulting website built with Next.js 14, Payload CMS, and Supabase. Features server-side rendering, dynamic content management, and responsive design.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **CMS**: Payload CMS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Email**: Resend API
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Key Features

- Server-side rendering
- Dynamic content management
- Responsive design
- Dark/Light theme support
- Email form submission
- SEO optimization
- Sitemap generation

## Important: Database Connection

### Supabase Connection Setup

When deploying to Vercel, you must use Supabase's Connection Pooler instead of Direct Connection. This is because:

1. Vercel's environment prioritizes IPv6
2. Supabase's Direct Connection may have IPv6 compatibility issues
3. Connection Pooler enforces IPv4 and provides better stability

#### Connection String Format:

❌ Don't use Direct Connection in production
DATABASE_URI=postgresql://postgres:password@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres

✅ Use Connection Pooler instead
DATABASE_URI=postgresql://postgres.xxx:password@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

To find your Connection Pooler URL:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Project Settings > Database
3. Connection Pooling section
4. Copy the Connection string

This setup ensures:

- IPv6/IPv4 compatibility
- Better connection management
- Improved stability
- Automatic connection handling

## Posts can't be published

1. e+1(without S3) works well. Is it because of S3?
2. seems like it is about localization and Related Posts and Categories?
